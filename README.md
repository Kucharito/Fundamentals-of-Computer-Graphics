# 🖼️ ZPG1111 – OpenGL Project

This repository contains a **C++ OpenGL project** developed as part of the ZPG course.  
The application demonstrates rendering 3D scenes, lighting, textures, transformations, and shaders.

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- **Visual Studio 2019/2022**  
- **C++17**  
- **OpenGL** + **GLEW**  
- **Assimp** (for loading 3D models)  

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ZPG1111.git
   cd ZPG1111
2. Open ZPG1111.sln in Visual Studio.

3. Make sure the required DLLs (glew32.dll, assimp-vc140-mt.dll) are present in the build directory.

4. Build and run the project.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Rendering of **3D models** (`.obj`) with materials and textures  
- ✅ Multiple **lighting models**: Phong, Blinn-Phong, Lambert, directional, point, spotlight  
- ✅ **Skybox (skycube)** rendering  
- ✅ **Transformations**: translation, rotation, scaling  
- ✅ Scene with multiple objects (house, cat model, zombie, trees, etc.)  
- ✅ Support for custom **GLSL shaders**  

## 📚 Used Libraries

- **GLEW** – OpenGL extension management  
- **GLFW** – Window and input handling  
- **GLM** – Mathematics library for vectors, matrices, and transformations  
- **Assimp** – Loading 3D models (e.g., `.obj`)  
- **SOIL** – Loading textures (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`)
